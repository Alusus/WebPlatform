## Signals

Signals enable the user to receive events from the asynchronous operations, wether from the UI or
other async operations.

### Signal

```
class Signal [ownerType: type, payloadType: type] {
    handler this.connect(slot: closure (ref[ownerType], payload: ref[payloadType]));
    handler this.disconnect(slot: closure (ref[ownerType], payload: ref[payloadType]));
    handler this.getConnectionCount (): Int;
}
```

A signal that can be subscribed to for handling events. It allows more than one subscriber.

#### Template Arguments

`ownerType`: The class that owns this signal, meaning the class within which this signal is
defined, such as `Widget`. This attribute specifies the type of the first argument in the
closure that will receive the events. The closure arg type is a reference to this class.

`payloadType`: The class of data that is passed to the closure. This attribute specifies
the type of the second closure argument, which is a reference to this class.

For example, if we define the signal as `Signal[Widget, String]`, the closure is defined as
follows:

```
closure (ref[Widget], ref[String]) { ... }
```


#### Methods

`connect` a method to connect a closure to the signal, so that when the signal emitted the closure
called and payload passed to it.

`disconnect` a method used to disconnect a closure connected by the previous method from the signal.

`getConnectionCount` a method that retrieve the number of connections with the signal.


### DomEventSignal

```
class DomEventSignal [ownerType: type, payloadType: type] {
    def defaultPrevented: Bool = false;
}
```

This class is derived from `Signal` and is used for DOM events.

`defaultPrevented` Specifies if the default action should be executed or skipped.
